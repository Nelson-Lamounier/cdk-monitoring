# @format
# @description Deploy K8s Infrastructure to Development
#
# Unified infrastructure pipeline for the K8s cluster.
# Deploys CDK stacks, syncs bootstrap scripts, builds Golden AMI,
# and runs verification — all in one pipeline.
#
# 8-Stack Architecture: Data → Base → Compute → AppIam → Api → Edge.
# Application workloads (monitoring, nextjs, traefik, metrics-server)
# are managed by ArgoCD via Pipeline B (gitops-k8s-dev.yml).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Shared VPC from deploy-shared workflow
