# Next.js Topology Helm Chart
#
# Thin overlay chart that manages deployment scaling, pod anti-affinity,
# and topology spread constraints. The base application resources (Service,
# ConfigMap, Secrets, Ingress) are deployed by kustomize in deploy-manifests.sh.
#
# This chart only patches the Deployment resource for topology-aware scheduling.
# It is designed to work alongside the existing kustomize pipeline, not replace it.
#
# Usage:
#   helm upgrade --install nextjs-topology ./chart -n nextjs-app -f ../nextjs-values.yaml
