# Grafana admin credentials
#
# The admin-password is NOT stored here — it's created at deploy-time
# by deploy-manifests.sh via `kubectl create secret`, which reads
# the password from SSM Parameter Store. This avoids sed-replacing
# placeholders in files and keeps secrets out of version control.
#
# The deploy script creates a secret named "grafana-credentials" with keys:
#   - admin-user: "admin"
#   - admin-password: <from SSM>
#
# This file is kept for reference and for Kustomize resource listing,
# but the actual secret is managed imperatively by the deploy script.
